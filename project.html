Project 1: Diastolic and compressive pressure detection
 </strong></font><br>
Given a piece of blood pressure data, we try to design an algorithm to detect the diastolic and compressive pressure. [<strong><a href="https://rdcu.be/b53FH">paper and code</a></strong>]

In the distributed framework, we use the scenario theory to deal with the uncertainty occuring in the optimization problem. We first extract some samples of uncertain variable, and then convert the uncertain optimization problem into a determined optimization problem. Now, we use the probability tools to evalute whether the optimal solution of the determined problem is feasible for the original problem .  Finally, we use a distributed algorithm to solve the determined problem.

In this paper, I propose a new index to detect the idiosyncratic uncertainty banks face at the bank-quarter level by applying natural language processing techniques to earnings conference call transcripts. The index reveals which banks at a given quarter signal more uncertainty about their balance sheets. Higher uncertainty is associated with lower lending the next quarter and higher liquidity, suggesting active management of uncertainty. The active management of uncertainty is more pronounced during periods of high aggregate volatility and for banks with more skin-in-the-game. Using loan-level data and firm-fixed effects, I control for demand-side factors and find higher bank-level uncertainty is associated with lower loan issuances the following quarter.</p>

<strong>Stressed Banks: Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</strong><br>with Puriya Abbassi, Rajkamal Iyer and Jos&eacute;-Luis Peydr&oacute;<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Regulation needs effective supervision; but regulated entities may deviate with unobserved actions. For identification, we analyze banks, exploiting ECB’s asset quality review (AQR) and supervisory security and credit registers. After AQR announcement, reviewed banks reduce riskier securities and credit (also overall securities and credit supply), with largest impact on riskiest securities (not on riskiest credit), and immediate negative spillovers on asset prices and firm-level credit supply. Exposed (unregulated) nonbanks buy the shed risk. AQR drives the results, not the end-of-year. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit, with medium-term negative firm-level real effects via credit. Results suggest banks mask risk in supervisory audits, especially using liquid securities that are easier to trade, with not only short-term spillovers on asset prices and credit supply, but also with medium-term implications for the real economy, holding important implications for policy.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Non-US firms have massively borrowed dollars (foreign currency, FX), leading to booms and crises. We show the real effects of capital controls, including benefits, through a firm-debt mechanism. For identification, we exploit a tax on FX-debt inflows in Colombia before the global financial crisis (GFC), and administrative, proprietary datasets, including credit register data and FX-debt inflows. Capital controls substantially reduce FX-debt inflows (larger for more-exposed-FX firms). Moreover, firms with weaker local banking relationships cannot substitute FX-debt with domestic-debt, thereby reducing imports. However, capital controls improve exports during the GFC –by preemptively reducing pre-crisis firm-level debt–, especially for financially-constrained firms.</p><br>-->
